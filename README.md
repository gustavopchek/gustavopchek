### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gustavo Pchek. I have been a software engineer since 2014, and in the past few years I dove deep into backend technologies, specially Ruby and Rails stack.

I also have an undergraduate degree in Internet Systems Technology from Federal Technological University of ParanÃ¡ (UTFPR) - Brazil.
